# Memory

## Related Skills

**Upstream Dependencies:** None

**Downstream Dependents:**
- `skill-creator` — The skill-creator skill references memory patterns for storing important facts during skill development

This skill is a foundational utility that provides persistent storage patterns used by other skills. The `skill-creator` skill recommends using memory patterns (MEMORY.md/HISTORY.md) when creating and iterating on skills.

## Structure

- `memory/MEMORY.md` — Long-term facts (preferences, project context, relationships). Always loaded into your context.
- `memory/HISTORY.md` — Append-only event log. NOT loaded into context. Search it with grep-style tools or in-memory filters. Each entry starts with [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM].

## Search Past Events

Choose the search method based on file size:

- Small `memory/HISTORY.md`: use `read_file`, then search in-memory
- Large or long-lived `memory/HISTORY.md`: use the `exec` tool for targeted search

Examples:
- **Linux/macOS:** `grep -i "keyword" memory/HISTORY.md`
- **Windows:** `findstr /i "keyword" memory\HISTORY.md`
- **Cross-platform Python:** `python -c "from pathlib import Path; text = Path('memory/HISTORY.md').read_text(encoding='utf-8'); print('\n'.join([l for l in text.splitlines() if 'keyword' in l.lower()][-20:]))"`

Prefer targeted command-line search for large history files.

## When to Update MEMORY.md

Write important facts immediately using `edit_file` or `write_file`:
- User preferences ("I prefer dark mode")
- Project context ("The API uses OAuth2")
- Relationships ("Alice is the project lead")

## Auto-consolidation

Old conversations are automatically summarized and appended to HISTORY.md when the session grows large. Long-term facts are extracted to MEMORY.md. You don't need to manage this.
